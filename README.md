## Web Auction Site

Auction (Ebay-like) Website Project (Web Applications Technology Course, DIT @ UoA): Created a functional website (front & backend) for trading items via auction. Implemented bidding, buying, messaging, searching and submitting auctions. Used Nearest Neighbour Collaborative Filtering to recommend items to users.    

Now, as of today, the company would require a lot of manual work to be done regarding generation of enquiries, receipt of quotation, generation of purchase order, confirmation etc…. 

All this can be done in a simplified way by our online facility, allowing an administrator, appointed by the company to access the company data base, interact with clients and suppliers, deal with them and transact accordingly. This enables the company to function in a much smoother way, obtain orders faster and clear off work in a more appropriate manner
